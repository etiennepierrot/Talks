#### FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN C#
Functional programming it's a clean and easily maintainable style, it's an important basis of programming as we know it today, and certain specific current concerns, like parallelization, can be targeted successfully with the help of functional programming ideas. In recent years, more and more functional elements have been included in imperative languages on the .NET platform like C# and VB.NET but many developers are not aware of them or don't know how to use it. In this talk you will learn how to leverage how functional way of coding can improve your imperative code. You'll learn about how to do dependency injection in a functional way, defining and reusing functions, currying and partial application, writing monads and implementing effectively a map/reduce pattern.
